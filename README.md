# Supabase Kotlin Plugins

This repository contains plugins for the [Supabase Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-kt). Each plugin extends the functionality of the SDK, allowing you to integrate with various libraries and frameworks.

Versions are independent of the main SDK version, so you can use the latest version of a plugin with any supported version of the SDK.
